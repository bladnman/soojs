SOOJS
=====

###Simple Object Oriented JavaScript pattern###


This is an extremely simple Pattern that allows projects to quickly, partially or fully use some of the standard OO patterns found in other languages.

This is definitely not a framework. The entire intention is to be as low-impact to a project as possible. If only 1 object in a project is SOOJS and nothing else is, that is perfectly fine. 

The power comes from not polluting and allowing all other Javascript paradigms to be possible. In fact, there is nothing you need to download. As a true pattern you just learn it and apply it.

Hosted here are some file templates which help you start new "classes" and a module with very very few helper methods that have NO MAGIC in them at all.

This is not magic, it's better. It's Sooooo-JS!

For a quick example you can check out the [TodoMVC app](http://www.bladnman.com/soojs/todoMVC/). 

I'm editing a series of blog posts about the pattern that will greatly clarify what SOOJS is all about and how it fits in your bat-belt. Until the time I am finally done with that it may be best to dive through the above example.
